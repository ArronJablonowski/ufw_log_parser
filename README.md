# ufw_log_parser.sh
Uncomplicated Firewall log parser displays UFW events in a format that is easy to view and understand. 
It parses ufw.log events for:
* Timestamp 
* Blocked / Allowed status
* Source MAC and IP
* Destination IP and Port.
* UDP/TCP    

## ufw logging verbosity 
ufw has 5 levels of verbosity: 
* off - logging is disabled 
* low (default) - Logs blocked packets that do not match the current firewall ruleset. Rate limited. 
* medium - All logs from 'low' plus logs for invalid packets, and new connections/allows. Rate limited.  
* high - All logs from 'medium' with less rate limiting than the medium setting.   
* full - Similar to 'high' without rate limits. 
 
My ufw logging verbosity preference for a unix workstation is 'medium'. *This may be too verbose on some servers. 

To set ufw's verbosity: 
```Bash
sudo ufw logging medium
```


## ufw_log_parser.sh Usage

Parse entire 'ufw.log' file:
```Bash
./ufw_log_parser.sh
```

Parse the last 30 entries in ufw.log:
```Bash
./ufw_log_parser.sh | tail -n 30
```

Watch a running feed of ufw.log, refreshing every 5 seconds: 
```Bash
watch -n5 "./ufw_log_parser.sh | tail -n 30"
```

Example use cases:
* Validate proper vlan segmentation.
* Determining if a network route is open to a system. 
* Parse ufw logs while troubleshooting or performing incident response.  
* See when your system is being poked and scanned at the local â˜• coffee shop.
* Watch your Chrome cast, etc. constantly scanning your systems. 
* Hours of entertainment at IT/Security conferences.
