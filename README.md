# ufw_log_parser.sh
Uncomplicated Firewall log parser displays UFW events in format that is easy to view and understand. 
It parses ufw.log events for:
* Timestamp 
* Blocked / Allowed status
* Source MAC and IP
* Destination IP and Port.    

## ufw logging verbosity 
ufw has 4 levels of verbosity: low (default), medium, high, & full
 
My ufw logging verbosity preference is 'medium'. To set ufw's verbosity: 
```Bash
sudo ufw logging medium
```


## ufw_log_parser.sh Usage

Parse entire 'ufw.log' file:
```Bash
./ufw_log_parser.sh
```

Parse the last 30 entries in UFW log:
```Bash
./ufw_log_parser.sh | tail -n 30
```

Watch a running feed of UFW logs, refreshing every 5 seconds: 
```Bash
watch -n5 "./ufw_log_parser.sh | tail -n 30"
```

Example use cases:
* Validate proper vlan segmentation.
* Determining if a network route is open to a system. 
* Parse ufw logs while troubleshooting or performing incident response.  
* See when your system is being poked and scanned at the local â˜• coffee shop.
* Watch your Chrome cast, etc. constantly scanning your systems. 
* Hours of entertainment at IT/Security conferences.
